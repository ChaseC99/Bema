# Bema
A custom tool used to judge official contests on Khan Academy. :tada:

The live tool can be viewed at http://bema.herokuapp.com/ but public users are not able to modify data or log in. If you're interested in contributing to this project, you're welcome to make a project fork to add your changes! For more information about contributing, please contact Evan Lewis.
